Just logging in to confirm that changing in /etc/nsswitch.conf:

group: files [SUCCESS=merge] systemd

to:

group: files systemd

does resolve the issue.

Hopefully this can be fixed soon. Alternately it would be fantastic if netplan could just output a systemd network config to an arbitrary directory...
